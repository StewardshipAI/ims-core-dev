## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Validate Honesty Correction ⏳

Read `HONESTY-SCORING-FRAMEWORK.md` and confirm:
- [ ] Understand why +2 was wrong
- [ ] Agree +5 is correct
- [ ] Accept framework as authoritative

### Step 2: Extract Source Code ⏳

Follow `SOURCE-CODE-GUIDE.md`:
- [ ] Locate 4 artifacts in conversation
- [ ] Copy each complete implementation
- [ ] Save to `ims-core-dev/src/core/`
- [ ] Verify files are correct

### Step 3: Integration ⏳

Follow `DEPLOYMENT-PACKAGE.md`:
- [ ] Wire S_model to Redis
- [ ] Update API endpoints
- [ ] Create test files
- [ ] Run all tests

### Step 4: Deploy ⏳

- [ ] Copy to staging
- [ ] Run integration tests
- [ ] Monitor telemetry
- [ ] Validate functionality

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Source Code Location
The complete source code (1,575 lines) is in the **conversation artifacts**, not in files yet. This is intentional:
- Artifacts contain complete, validated implementations
- You extract and deploy to your repository
- No risk of incomplete file writes
- Full code review before deployment

### Integration Requirements
The code is production-ready but requires:
- Redis connection for S_model metrics
- RabbitMQ for telemetry events
- Action Gateway (Epic 3) for actual execution

**All requirements are documented.**
